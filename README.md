# Tetris

Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle video game. 

## Gameplay

- Tetriminos spawn at the top of the grid and gradually move down.
- Arrange Tetriminos to fill complete horizontal lines.
- Cleared lines award points and increase the player's level.
- With each level, the game's speed increases, adding to the challenge.
- The game ends when a new Tetrimino can't fit at the top.
